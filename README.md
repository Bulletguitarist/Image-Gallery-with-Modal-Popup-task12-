# Image Gallery with Modal Popup

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **responsive image gallery** built using **HTML, CSS Grid, and JavaScript**.  
The gallery displays images in a **symmetrical grid layout**, and clicking on any image opens a **modal popup** with an enlarged view.

The modal includes a background overlay, smooth animations, and keyboard support to enhance the user experience.
